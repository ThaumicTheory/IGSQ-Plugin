#Welcome to the official repository of the IGSQ mc server software.
This is the inhouse plugin developed specifically for our minecraft server!
You are welcome to peek inside but you shall be warned that there will be many spoilers for up and coming features to the server!

The software is built for the newest version of minecraft and java only
> The only exception being the WIP "community modded LTS version" spigot (and technically bungee) builds meant for a cauldron fork such as magma
> * note these builds will only be backports of the main build.

The software supports both bungee and spigot and has them both combined into a single jar file; it is required to be included in bungee and all spigot servers you want to communicate with! 
* Full support for paper and waterfall (forks of spigot and bungee respectively) should be expected as this is what the IGSQ server runs on

> Therefor any mentions of spigot and bungee in this document can be replaced with paper and waterfall respectively :)

##Dependencies
#The plugin depends on both Luckperms (a permissions api) and protocollib (a protocol api)
The bungee plugin requires [Luckperms 5.4](https://luckperms.net/)
* although not required you probably would wnt to install it on all your spigot servers

The spigot plugin requires [protocollib 5.0.0](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/)
